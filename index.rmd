It's Simple. You're in Stats 250. You're looking for some help. We are past instructors and GSIs to the course, looking to provide that help. [See our bios here!](./biography.html)

# *Tutoring*

Sometimes, it helps to have a human in the room. We know this better than anyone, and are more than happy to help. Fill out [this quick form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSen964ejZ8pAmJq0ktwgLRo1mRJ8HEC9od6aMHlecTn17uFWA/viewform) if you are interested in setting up a session!

We have four types of tutoring available: 

<!-- # ```{r, echo = F} -->
<!-- # knitr::kable(data.frame(Type = c("Local 1-1 Tutoring", "Group Local Tutoring", "1-1 Online Tutoring", "Group Online Tutoring"), Price = c("19.99 Per Session", "14.99 Per Session", "19.99 Per Session", "9.99 Per Session"))) -->
<!-- # ``` -->

```{r, echo = F}
library(magrittr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dat <- data.frame(`Tutoring Type` = c(
  "Local 1-1",
  "Online 1-1",
  "Group Local Tutoring",
  "Group Online Tutoring",
  "Group Options"
  ),
  Description = c(
    "If you really feel best with some help in person, this is the most personalized option",
    "We can hop online and offer custom online help for any of your questions. This is the best option for late-night / tutoring that you never have to leave your home! ",
    "If you don't mind having up to five other students at the session with you, this is a great option for personal in-person tutoring",
    "The most economical, we host online multi-person group study sessions that will will get you ready for the exams. There can be quite a few students at these sessions, but if you are on a tight budget, this is the way to go!",
    "I know I said there are only four options, but if you have a few friends that would like to all jump in an online or in-person session together, we offer discounts for each person that joins!"
    ), check.names = F)
