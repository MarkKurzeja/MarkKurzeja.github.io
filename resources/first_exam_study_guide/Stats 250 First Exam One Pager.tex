	\begin{topic}{Introduction}
		This summary is not meant to be comprehensive. By using this document, you acknowledge you have read the disclaimer.
		\begin{compactdesc}
			\item[Intrepretations] Look back at Exam One and Exam Two for the interpretations of things like p-values and other vocabulary. Remember to be concise when presenting these on an exam - sometimes saying more than necessary can hurt more than it helps.
			\item[The Formula Card] Knowing how to quickly utilize the formula card is helpful for many of the problems you may encounter. The notation on the formula card is correct, and a good habit is to always check the formula card whenever you feel you have hit a dead-end. Often, a formula or hint on the card can provide the next step to finish the problem. 
			\item[Name that scenerio] Being able to identify which test you are looking at quickly and accurately is invaluable. The assumptions, interpretations, distributions, and conclusions all hinge on selecting the correct test, so be sure to study name-that-scenario questions
			\item[Broad Concepts] The final will test your understanding of broad concepts in this course. Make sure you have a grasp of the big picture as well as the methodology behind each test. 
			\item[Remember] To get a good nights sleep and practice taking an exam towards the later part of the day. This is a later exam than most. Be sure to prepare yourself by taking a practice exam around the time of our actual exam. 
		\end{compactdesc}
	\end{topic}
	
	\begin{topic}{General Probability Questions}
		Probability is one of the more difficult units in the class because it sometimes is difficult to decipher what the question is asking. Remember a few simple rules before you start any probability question to start off on the right foot:
		\begin{compactenum}
			\item Most problems involve using one or at most two formulas on the formula card. Begin by defining terms. For example, if we are looking at the probability of it raining vs the probability of you smiling, then let $ A =$ ``It is raining'' and let $ B =  $ ``You are Smiling''. Then we can use the formulas on our formula card directly.
			\item When you see something that looks \textit{like} coin flips then you are probably dealing with a binomial problem. For instance, if we are trying to see what the probability of 10 out of our 15 neighbors love chocolate, and we know that the probability of loving chocolate is 90\%, then this is probably a binomial problem. For this we need:
			\begin{compactitem}
				\item It has a yes/no style question
				\item It has a fixed number of ``flips'' 
			\end{compactitem}
		\end{compactenum}
	\end{topic}
	
	\begin{topic}{Mutual Exclusivity and Independence}
		These two are \textit{not} the same thing! The exams generally test this
		\begin{compactdesc}
			\item[Mutual Exclusivity] This says that the two events cannot happen at the same time. If so $ P(A \text{ and } B) = 0 $. Example: If we flip a coin, we cannot get a head and a tail in the same toss 
			\item[Independence] This says that knowing something about $ A $ will tell us nothing about $ B $. The formula on the formula card is: $ P(A | B) = P(A) $, but an easier formula for these problems is to check does this hold: $ P(A \text{ and }  B) = P(A) \times P(B) $. This formula is not on your formula card but always comes in handy. Example: If I flip a head on turn one and the probability of flipping a head is 50\%, the probability that I flip a head on turn two is still 50\% on turn two!
		\end{compactdesc}
		Something \textit{cannot} be both mutually exclusive and independent! 
	\end{topic} 	
	\begin{topic}{Probability Example}
		Let's imagine that we saw the following on the exam: ``The probability of it raining is 30\%. The probability of you not smiling is 20\%. The probability of it raining or you smiling is 50\%.''
		\begin{compactdesc}
			\item[Problem Setup] First thing's first: always set up the problem by putting labels to things! We will let $ A = \text{Probability of it Raining} $ and $ B = \text{Probability of you smiling} $
			\item[Writing out the problem in Symbols] This step makes things a lot easier since we can now use our formula card
			\begin{align*}
			P(A) &= 30\% \text{ Given in the problem}\\
			P(\text{Not }B) &= 20\% \text{ We have the probabilty of not smiling}\\
			P(A \text{ or } B) &= 50\% 
			\end{align*} 
			\item[Solving for things we want] Let's find the probability of smiling
			\begin{align*}
			P(B) = 1 - P(\text{Not }B) = 1 - 20\% = 80\%
			\end{align*}  
			\item[Are Smiling and Raining Mutually Exclusive?] This is where writing out the problem in symbols helps out a lot because we can use what we have from the formula card:
			\begin{align*}
			\underbrace{P(A \text{ or } B)}_{50\%} &= \underbrace{P(A)}_{30\%} + \underbrace{P(B)}_{80\%} - \underbrace{P(A\text{ and }B)}_{???}
			\intertext{and solving out the algebra gives us:}
			P(A\text{ and }B) &= P(A \text{ or }B) - P(A) - P(B)\\
			&= 60\%
			\end{align*}
			Because $ P(A\text{ and }B) $ is not equal to zero, we can say that Smiling and Raining are not mutually exclusive!
			\item[Are Smiling and Raining Independent?] We can use the fact that Smiling and Raining are Independent only if $ P(A) \times P(B) = P(A \text{ and }B) $. Does this hold? We will use the answer from the last problem to help us. 
			\begin{align*}
			\underbrace{P(A)}_{30\%} \times \underbrace{P(B)}_{80\%} &\overset{?}{=} \underbrace{P(A\text{ and } B)}_{60\%}\\
			24\% &\neq 60\%
			\end{align*} 
			and thus we can see that $ A $ and $ B $ (Raining and Smiling) are not independent because the formula is not equal on both sides.
