			\begin{compactdesc}
				\item[Intrepretations] Look back at Exam One and Exam Two for the interpretations of things like p-values and other vocabulary. Remember to be concise when presenting these on an exam - sometimes saying more than necessary can hurt more than it helps.
				\item[The Formula Card] Knowing how to quickly utilize the formula card is helpful for many of the problems you may encounter. The notation on the formula card is correct, and a good habit is to always check the formula card whenever you feel you have hit a dead-end. Often, a formula or hint on the card can provide the next step to finish the problem. 
				\item[Name that scenerio] Being able to identify which test you are looking at quickly and accurately is invaluable. The assumptions, interpretations, distributions, and conclusions all hinge on selecting the correct test, so be sure to study name-that-scenario questions
				\item[Broad Concepts] The final will test your understanding of broad concepts in this course. Make sure you have a grasp of the big picture as well as the methodology behind each test. 
%				\item[Remember] To get a good nights sleep and practice taking an exam towards the later part of the day. This is a later exam than most. Be sure to prepare yourself by taking a practice exam around the time of our actual exam.

		\topic{Difference in Population Means}{
			This test compares the means of two independent populations. We say that this is a ``difference in population means'' and not a ``population mean difference''. When you notice that you are comparing two population means and the subgroups have a different size, this is a good indication that you will be using this test and not a paired test. However, this doesn't imply that if the sample sizes are the same that it is automatically a paired test. Make sure to do lots of name-that-scenario to get a good understanding of this distinction.

			\begin{tellme}{Do we use pooled or unpooled variance?}
				\begin{compactitem}

				\end{compactitem}
				\begin{compactenum}
					\item Side-by-Side boxplots
					\begin{compactitem}
						\item Are IQRs of the sample data similar?
						\item Remember, boxes don't need to line up, but lengths of boxes should be similar (within two times the size of each other)
					\end{compactitem}
					\item Check on Sample Standard Deviations
					\begin{compactitem}
						\item Assumption is valid if sample standard deviations are similar. Each standard deviation is no more than 2x the other. 
					\end{compactitem}
					\item \textbf{Levene's test} for homogeneity of variances
					\begin{compactitem}
						\item Hypothesis test of equal variances. Use $\boldsymbol{\alpha=0.10}$
						\item $H_0:\sigma_1^2=\sigma_2^2\text{ v. }H_a:\sigma_1^2\neq\sigma_2^2$
						\item Reject $H_0\implies$ not reasonable to assume equal variances. You must run an unpooled test (Welch's)

		\topic{Determination of $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ (Type I \& Type II Error)}{
			You may get questions on determining $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ (probability of a type I or type II error), or you may be given two different distributions (think about the homework problem where we had two farmers and we were trying to decide whether a pumpkin belonged to Farmer A or Farmer B). 
			
			Always begin by drawing the null and the alternative distributions. They may look something like this 
			
			\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{distrsAnno}
			
			Note: \textit{They do NOT need to be normally distributed - they can be normal, uniform, or any other distribution}:
			Most problems will have a decision criteria. They will say, ``Greater than value $ X $ we choose the alternative, else we choose the null''. This $ X $ is the vertical line in the distribution drawn. From here, just think about what each question is asking and how to go about finding the p-values that they are wondering about.

		\topic{Linear Regression}{
			Linear regression is all about finding relationships between a response $ Y $ and a predictor $ X $. 
			
			\begin{tellme}{Assumptions}
				\begin{compactitem}
					\item There is a linear relationship between the population of responses and the population of the predictor 
					\item True Errors are Normally Distributed
					\item True Errors have a constant variance (homoscedasticity)
				\end{compactitem}
			\end{tellme}
			
			\begin{tellme}{QuickFacts}
				\begin{compactdesc}
					\item When we \textbf{extrapolate}, we make a prediction of $y$ for an $x$ that is outside of the range that we fit the data on. Imagine that we are predicting the blood pressure of adult males aged 18-40 using a model. We recruit males aged 18 to 40 and then fit our model, but then we are asked to run this model on a 60 year old male or on a female. These points are outside of our sample, and thus we need to be very careful with predictions from our model. 
					\item[Distribution of Test Statistic] If the test is a two sided test, we can use either the T Test Statistic on the $ b_1 $coefficient or the F Test Statistic at the bottom of the test. If it is one-sided, we have to use the T Test Statistic. The F-statistic is related to the T Test Statistic by: $ F = t^2 $ 
					\item[Common Mistakes]  Always be sure to be on the lookout for questions that are testing that you know that \textit{correlation does not imply causation}. Also, always try to write out the form of the regression equation in words - this tends to help out a lot. It is often better to write $Final = b_0 + b_1\times Exam2$ than $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x$ to keep them straight on the exam.

			\begin{tellme}{Interpreting the R Output and Plots}
				\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{routput}	
			\end{tellme}
			
			In this class, our interpretation of $ \beta_1 $ is the true change in mean for the response variable for every additional unit increase in the explanatory variable. $R^2$ is the percent of the variation in the response variable explained by the linear relationship between response and predictor 
			
			\begin{compactitem}
				\item A scatter plot can tell us a lot about the relationship between two variables
				\item We can view a scatterplot to look for:
				\begin{compactenum}
					\item Shape/form
					\begin{compactitem}
						\item Linear or non-linear relationship  (does it look like a cup or a rainbow?)
					\end{compactitem}
					\item Direction
					\begin{compactitem}
						\item Positive or negative correlation
					\end{compactitem}
					\item Strength of relationship
					\begin{compactitem}

			There are three different types of Chi-Squared tests. 
			\begin{compactitem}
				\item Test of Independence
				\item Test of Homogeneity
				\item Goodness of Fit
			\end{compactitem}
			Each test uses the same test statistic given by: 
			\begin{align*}
			\chi^{2} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{(\text{Observed} - \text{Expected})^{2}}{\text{Expected}} \,\, {\bigg \vert} \,\, \text{Contribution} = \frac{(\text{Obs} - \text{Exp})^{2}}{\text{Exp}} 
			\end{align*}
			The further away our observation is away from what we would expect, the larger the test statistic.
			
			\begin{tellme}{Discerning the Three Types of Tests}
				\begin{compactdesc}
					\item[Goodness of Fit]  
					This test answers the question, ``Do the data fit well compared to a specified distribution?'' It considers one categorical response, and assesses whether the proportion of sampled observations falling into each category matches well to a specified distribution. The null hypothesis specifies this distribution which describes the population proportion of observations in each category.
					%	There is one population and one categorical variable.
					Ex: Imagine that one grabs a bag of MM's. MM's lists the color distribution as: According to it, each package of Milk Chocolate M\&M’s should contain 24\% blue, 14\% brown, 16\% green, 20\% orange, 13\% red, and 14\% yellow M\&M’s. We could take a few packs of MM's and compare our observed percentages to what we would expect to see if we are getting results consistent with MM's website. 
					
					\item[Test of Homogeneity] 
					This test answers the question, ``Do two or more populations have the same distribution for one categorical variable?''  It considers one categorical response, and assesses whether the model for this response is the same in two (or more) populations. The null hypothesis is that the distribution of the categorical variable is the same for the two (or more) populations.
					%	We have one categorical variable and two or more populations.
					Ex. I have five TV shows and I am trying to see if each of the proportions of men and women are the same across the five shows. 
					
					\item[Test of Independence] This test answers the question, ``Are two factors (or variables) independent for a population under study?'' It considers two categorical variables (sometimes one is a response and the other is explanatory), and assesses whether there appears to be a relationship between these two variables for a single population. The null hypothesis is that the two categorical variables are independent (not related) for the population of interest. 
					%	We have two categorical variables and one population. 
					Ex: Imagine that I was trying to determine if someones school year (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior), is independent of where they live on campus (in the dorms, off campus, at home, fraternity / sorority)

				\end{compactdesc}
			\end{tellme}
			
			\begin{tellme}{Independence vs. Homogeneity}
				You'll see that the test for independence and homogeneity are easily confused. Some quick tips:
				\begin{compactitem}
					\item Check the sampling method and the problem setup
					\item In tests for Homogeneity, we have two or more populations and only one variable. In independence testing we have one population and more than one variable.
					\item In tests for Homogeneity, we have two or more samples. In independence tests, we have one sample and record two variables
					\item In tests for Homogeneity, the question is asking if the populations are \textit{different}. In tests for independence, we are asking if the \textit{variables} are \textit{independent} or \textit{associated}
					\item What if...
					\begin{compactitem}
						\item I took a random sample of wedding guests and recorded if they were from the bride’s side or the groom’s side and what type of meal they wanted. (Independence)
						\item I took a random sample of wedding guests from the bride’s side and a second random sample from the groom’s side and recorded what type of meal they wanted. (Homogeneity)
